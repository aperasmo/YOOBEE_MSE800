## Can we update the code with adding a "Course" class to Week 5, Activity 3? See attached file: 

1. Yes we can add a Course class to the existing code structure. But, we cannot be able to use the inheritance feature because that class is not logically related.
2. The Course class can represent a course that students can enroll in.
3. The Course class should have attributes like course name, course code, and credits.
4. Then, we can create a Student class that inherits from Person and also has a list of courses they are enrolled in.
5. The Student class should have methods to add a course, remove a course, and display all enrolled courses.
